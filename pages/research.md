<h1 style="text-align: center;">Plant Morphology, Statistical Phylogenetics and  Evo-Devo </h1>

I am captivated by origin stories in biology. Both across evolutionary time and across organismal time. The past has a unique way of contextualizing the present and providing insight into the future. My research focuses on characterizing the processes that have produces the vast organismal diversity that exists. My approaches primarily fall into the field of Evolution and Developmental Biology, specifically the subdisciplines of phylogenetic comparative methods and plant morphology. 



## Development- Plant Morphology
<img src="/assets/img/EpiIllumination.png">

A key focus of mine is to understand how are diverse developmental structure generated by organisms. Primarily I have focused on reproductive structures in angiosperms (i.e., flowers and inflorescences). I use tools from genetics, molecular biology and imaging to understand how plant meristems (stem cells) organize themselves and differentiate into diverse structures. For some examples of research in this field see,

## Evolution - Phylogenetic Statistical Methods
<img src="/assets/img/HiddenCTMM.png">

Another piller of my work is understanding how developmental and mature traits have evolved. Key to this is making accurate and realistic inference of what organisms looked like in the pass. To this end I have focused on developing statistical phylogenetic methods that integrate our knowledge of plant morphology. I am also generally intrested in how biologist interrpret models of evolutionary biology. For research related to this see,

## Collaboration - From Ontologies to Floral Scent
While my own personal academic intrests drive my research program it is hard to not be captivatied by science of my peers. To the extent that I have published with fellow graduates in fields tangential to my expertise. These have been fruitful endevors and I am always looking for new avenues of investigation!

## Funding
I have been lucky to have been supported by a number agenies throughout my academic career. They have allowed me to purse my education and research and I have them to thank for output. For a complete list see my [CV](https://jesusthebotanist.github.io/pages/cv.html)
