Hello! I am a third year graduate student in [Chelsea Specht's lab](http://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/) in Plant biology at  Cornell. I consider myself an evolutionary biologist interested in understanding the process that give rise to diverse patterns of developmental morphology. My dissertation research is focused on the evolution of inflorescences – branches of flowers, in the Amaryllis family *(Amaryllidaceae)* with a specific emphasize on the Onion/Garlic genus *(Allium)*. To learn more about this Umbel-ivable phenotypes (or if you don't understand the pun), check out my [research page](https://jesusthebotanist.github.io/projects/Umbels.html) for more details!
