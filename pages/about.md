I am a recently graduate Ph.D in [Chelsea Specht's lab](http://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/) at Cornell University. I consider myself evolutionary biologist interested in the processes that give rise to diverse patterns of morphology. My dissertation is focused on the evolution of inflorescences â€“ branches of flowers, in the Amaryllis family *(Amaryllidaceae)* with a specific emphasize on the Onion/Garlic genus *(Allium)*. To learn more about this Umbel-ivable phenotypes (or if you don't understand the pun), check out my [research page](https://jesusthebotanist.github.io/projects/Umbels.html).

In the Fall I will be joining the [Blackman Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/blackmanlab/Blackman_Lab/Welcome.html) at U.C., Berkeley as a U.C., Presidential Post-doctoral Fellow
