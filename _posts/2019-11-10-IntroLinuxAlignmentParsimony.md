I wrote the following worksheet for the Cornell PL6401 Ecology and Evolution module. This is a lab course for first year Plant Biology graduate students that introduces students to diverse topics that they will encounter in Plant biology. [Eugenio Valderrama](http://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/eugenio-valderrama/), [Jacob Landis](http://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/jacob-landis/) and myself led the Ecology and Evolution module. 

The worksheet is a very brief and coverse basic linux, alignment with mafft and parsimony with TNT. The GitHub has Jacob's (Maximum likelihood and Baysien) and Eugenio's (ecology) material [here](https://github.com/Jesusthebotanist/PLBIO6401_EcologyEvolution_Module_2019). I wrote this in Markdown and knitted this with Pandoc, you can find the [Markdown](https://github.com/Jesusthebotanist/PLBIO6401_EcologyEvolution_Module_2019/tree/master/Day1/markdownFiles).
