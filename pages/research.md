<h1 style="text-align: center;">Plant Morphology, Statistical Phylogenetics and  Evo-Devo </h1>

I am captivated by origin stories in biology. Both across evolutionary time and across organismal time. The past has a unique way of contextualizing the present and providing insight into the future. My research focuses on characterizing the processes that have produces the vast organismal diversity that exists. My approaches primarily fall into the field of Evolution and Developmental Biology, specifically the subdisciplines of phylogenetic comparative methods and plant morphology.
